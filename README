TO RUN:

From the root directory, run "mvn package" and then ./run wearableWeather.sqlite3.
In your web browser, visit "localhost:4567/login." There is a default user in the
database with username "default" and password "default." The default user already
has clothing in the database, but you may choose to create a new user if you want.

TO USE:

Simply click "Get Outfit Suggestion" to receive an outfit suggestion based on the
weather. You may also choose to select a specific formality level or change the 
location. Click the "My Wardrobe" tab to view your wardrobe. On this page, you can
choose to add or remove clothing from your wardrobe.

KNOWN BUGS/ERRORS:

Due to time constraints on creating this project, we were unable to create high
quality images for the clothing items. Instead, we devised a way to programatically
color an image of a white clothing item.

There is a minor bug: sometimes, the clothing images do not immediately appear.
Simply click the "my wardrobe" tab again to load the images. Double-clicking
the tab will guarantee that the images appear.
